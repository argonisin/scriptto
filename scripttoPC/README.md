# Scriptto
[reminder!]
This is the CMD version of Scriptto. Use `CLEAR` instead of `CLS` as it will not clean the terminal whenever it is used.

## Development Log

### 9/21/24
- Implemented login functionality using JSON.
- Added a sign-up feature.
- Currently working on the `start_menu()` where player data will be saved.
- Encountering a significant number of bugs, which won't be detailed in this log.

### 9/22/24
- Improved the login and sign-up functionality.
- Successfully saved player metadata and can load it into `menu.py`, although there are still numerous bugs.
- The source code may appear messy as it hasn't been beautified or organized. Some functions are unnecessary, and long code segments could be simplified.
- Planning to work on the profile panel next.
